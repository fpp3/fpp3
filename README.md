## Featured Projects

### [mCALCAN](https://github.com/its-villada/mCALCAN)
- **Description**: A national and free contest hosted by [CONAE](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/conae "CONAE") and [MinCyT](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia "MinCyT"), to promote scientific investigation in teenagers in their last years of high school. The contest was to solve or aliviate a problematic in our province, and solving it by introducing, designing, and developing a [CanSAT](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cansat "CanSAT"). Our highschool and group got selected as one of 5 winners of 700 participants across the whole country, and we got to launch our CanSAT. (more [here](https://www.argentina.gob.ar/ciencia/sact/cansat-argentina "here"))
- **Technologies**: C++, Python, Qt, KiCad.

### PlasticBottleRecycler: [fw](https://github.com/fpp3/PlasticBottleRecycler-fw), [pcb](https://github.com/fpp3/PlasticBottleRecycler-pcb), [hw]()
- **Description**: A machine to turn any kind of PET plastic bottles into usable, FDM 3D printer filament. Based on the STMicroelectronics STM8 platform.
- **Technologies**: C, kicad, make, sdcc.

### [SAPEI](https://github.com/fpp3/SAPEIClient)
- **Description**: A hands-on assignment to use Object Oriented Programming, in order to solve a local problematic. We chose ingress/egress optimization of vehicles in the parking lot of our university.
- **Technologies**: C, C++, Qt, make, git, avr-gcc, arduino-cli, doxygen, vim, Linux.
